An interactive AI-powered drawing application built with OpenCV and Mediapipe that lets you paint in mid-air using just your hand gestures — no physical tools needed!

✨ Features
🖌️ Selection Mode – Choose your brush color or tool by holding your index finger and middle finger up.

✏️ Drawing Mode – Draw freely on the canvas by raising only your index finger.

🧹 Erasing Mode – Switch to eraser by selecting it and move your hand to erase parts of your drawing.

🔄 Reset Canvas – Show all fingers to instantly clear the screen and start fresh.


🛠️ How It Works
Hand Tracking – Uses Mediapipe Hands to detect landmarks and finger states in real time.

Gesture Recognition – Determines which mode you’re in based on the number of fingers raised.

Drawing on Frame – Overlays lines, shapes, and eraser strokes directly on the camera feed using OpenCV.
